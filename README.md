# LocalMart-user
a user side app
This is a react native app for the user side of things.Kindly follow the best practices given below to ensure a smooth coding experience
for you and your friends.


All the functionality for the app goes into the src folder.

Any new activity to be created must be contained in its own folder, the folder the activity file names being the same.
This newly created activity must have a activity_style file containing the style necessary for that activity.
This is how the project directory should look:-


    Android
  
    IOS
  
    src
  
      activity_name
    
        activity_name.js
      
        activity_name_style.js
  
    app.js
  
  .
  
  .
  
  .

These practices must be followed to ensure clean code and easy debugging once the project grows to humongous scales.
